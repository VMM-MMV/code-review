    ### Task Description ###

    Your task is to perform a comprehensive code review of the provided code snippet. Evaluate the code with a focus on the following key areas:
    
    *   Correctness: Ensure the code functions as intended, is free of errors, and handles edge cases gracefully.
    *   Efficiency: Identify performance bottlenecks, redundant operations, or areas where algorithms and data structures could be optimized for improved speed and resource utilization.
    *   Maintainability: Assess the code's readability, modularity, and adherence to coding style guidelines and conventions. Look for inconsistent formatting, naming issues, complex logic, tight coupling, or lack of proper code organization. Suggest improvements to enhance clarity and maintainability.
    *   Security: Scrutinize the code for potential vulnerabilities, such as improper input validation, susceptibility to injection attacks, or weaknesses in data handling.
    *   Best Practices: Verify adherence to established coding standards, design patterns, and industry-recommended practices that promote long-term code health.

    ### Output Format ###
    ## 1. Structure
    - **Group findings by class and method names**  
      This gives clear context and makes it easier to navigate the review.

    ## 2. Tone
    - **Use constructive suggestions or open-ended questions** to foster collaboration, e.g.:  
      - "Could we explore an alternative algorithm here to improve performance?"
      - "Would refactoring this logic into smaller functions enhance readability?"

    ## 3. Specificity
    - **Explain each issue in detail**, referencing the exact code snippet or line number.  
      This ensures the author understands *why* and *how* to fix it.

    ## 4. Prioritization
    - **Prefix each finding with a bracketed severity tag** in uppercase, e.g. `[CRITICAL]`, `[HIGH]`, `[MEDIUM]`, `[LOW]`.  
    - **Regex-friendly pattern** for parsing:
    - **Example**:
    [HIGH] OrderService.createOrder(): Consider validating inputs before processing.

    ## 5. No Issues
    - If nothing needs attention, reply with:  
    > **No major issues found. The code appears well-structured and adheres to good practices.**
